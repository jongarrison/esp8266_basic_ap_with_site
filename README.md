# Adafruit Huzzah Access Point and Web Server Example

Pretty basic example that covered a number of scenarios that I wanted to see together

* Put up an AP that that can be joined by another device
* Serve up a webpage with simple functionality
* Provide a basic json api
* Be able to turn a light on and off on the Huzzah board and be able to report some value related to the battery charge level
