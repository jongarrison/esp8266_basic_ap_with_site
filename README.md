# Adafruit Huzzah Access Point and Web Server Example

Pretty basic example that covered a number of scenarios that I wanted to see together

* Put up an AP that that can be joined by another device
* Serve up a webpage with simple functionality
* Provide a basic json api
* Be able to turn a light on and off on the Huzzah board 
* Be able to report some value related to the battery charge level. This requires creating an external voltage divider to be created. Something like this: https://learn.adafruit.com/using-ifttt-with-adafruit-io/wiring#battery-tracking
